TODO:

* gilberto feedback
* fix game loop (sort of fixed, rendering seems very smooth)
* adtf memory leak for camera images (circumvented not fixed)
* adtf transfer control info
* adtf split control filters
* fix camera movement
- send correct camera parameters to adtf
- option to sync simulation to actually processed frames
- sync input handling via scene
- show grid on floor
- add floor sign models
- MSAA for FBOs


Problem Marker Module:
 
if objects are stored in a vector the memory address cannot be used to uniquely
identify a given object, because the vector may reallocate the objects at a
different point in memory
    
in this case the selection may be dropped or may refer to another marker
each pose therefore needs a unique id
-> can be achieved with Id<T> struct

how to avoid dereferencing deallocated pointer?
call marker module at the very end!
